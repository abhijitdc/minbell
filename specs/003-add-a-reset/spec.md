# Feature Specification: Timer Reset Option

**Feature Branch**: `003-add-a-reset`  
**Created**: 2025-09-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add a reset option for the timer."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to be able to reset the timer at any point during a session, so that I can easily restart or correct a session.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the timer is running, **When** I click the "Reset" button, **Then** the timer should stop, reset to its initial duration, and all visual indicators should reset.
2. **Given** the timer is stopped, **When** I click the "Reset" button, **Then** the timer should reset to its initial duration, and all visual indicators should reset.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the "Reset" button is clicked rapidly multiple times? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should it debounce or handle rapid clicks gracefully?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a visible "Reset" button.
- **FR-002**: When the "Reset" button is clicked, the timer MUST stop.
- **FR-003**: When the "Reset" button is clicked, the timer MUST reset to its initial duration.
- **FR-004**: When the "Reset" button is clicked, all visual progress indicators MUST reset to their initial state.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **TimerState**: The existing TimerState will need to be updated to handle a reset action.
