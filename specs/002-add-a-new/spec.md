# Feature Specification: Visual Progress Indicator

**Feature Branch**: `002-add-a-new`  
**Created**: 2025-09-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add a new feature to show a visual element in the application that can show the gradual completion of inetrval and the entire duration"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to see a visual representation of the progress within the current interval and the overall session duration, so I can easily gauge my meditation progress without relying solely on audio cues.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a session is active, **When** time progresses within an interval, **Then** a visual element should gradually fill or change to indicate the completion of that interval.
2. **Given** a session is active, **When** time progresses across multiple intervals, **Then** a separate visual element should gradually fill or change to indicate the overall completion of the session duration.
3. **Given** a session is started, **When** the timer is running, **Then** the visual elements should update smoothly and in real-time.

### Edge Cases
- What happens to the visual elements when the timer is paused or stopped? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should they reset, hold their current state, or fade out?]
- How should the visual elements behave if the interval or duration is very short or very long? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the minimum/maximum durations/intervals for effective visualization?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a visual indicator for the progress of the current interval.
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a visual indicator for the overall progress of the session duration.
- **FR-003**: The visual indicators MUST update in real-time as the timer progresses.
- **FR-004**: The visual indicators MUST be clear and easy to understand.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **TimerState**: Represents the current state of the timer, including elapsed time for the current interval and overall session.
