# Feature Specification: Interval Timer

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-application`  
**Created**: 2025-09-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "build an application to help me keep a duartion udring a mediatation session. Example I might wangt to track every 5 mins for a 15 mins session or every minute for a 5 mins session. The user would be able to choose a duartion and an interval for reminder. The application will also give option to choose a sound for reminder from a meditation bell to a gentle water drop sound"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to be able to set a total duration and an interval for reminders for my meditation session, so that I can focus on my meditation without having to keep track of time. I also want to be able to choose a sound for the reminder.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application is open, **When** I set a duration of 15 minutes and an interval of 5 minutes, **Then** the timer should start and a reminder should sound at 5, 10 and 15 minutes.
2. **Given** the application is open, **When** I choose "gentle water drop" as the reminder sound, **Then** the reminder sound should be a gentle water drop.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user sets an interval that is longer than the total duration?
- If the user closes the app during a session, the session will end.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to set a total duration for the meditation session.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to set an interval for reminders.
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a selection of reminder sounds, including "meditation bell" and "gentle water drop".
- **FR-004**: System MUST play the selected reminder sound at each interval.
- **FR-005**: System MUST end the session after the total duration has elapsed.
- **FR-006**: The interval options presented to the user MUST be clean divisors of the chosen duration.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Session**: Represents a single meditation session, with attributes for total duration, interval, and selected sound.
- **Sound**: Represents a reminder sound option.
