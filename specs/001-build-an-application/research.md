# Research: Interval Timer

## UI Framework

**Decision**: Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

**Rationale**: 
- Using vanilla technologies keeps the project lightweight and focused.

**Alternatives considered**:
- `shadcn/ui`: While powerful, it introduces additional complexity (Tailwind CSS, React/Vue context) that is not strictly necessary for this simplified approach.

## Sound Handling

**Decision**: Play .wav audio files from the assets directory

**Rationale**: 
- Directly addresses the user's request.
- Provides flexibility for custom sounds.

**Research Task**: N/A
