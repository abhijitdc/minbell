# Feature Specification: Engaging Graphics for Interval Timer

**Feature Branch**: `004-new-feature-where`  
**Created**: Saturday 13 September 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "new feature where the background of the app is solid white and a chareter pops up randomly at the end of each interval and the application start with ine charecter image. This graphics will make the app more engaging"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to see engaging graphics, including a solid white background and a character appearing at intervals, to make my meditation sessions more visually appealing and enjoyable.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application starts, **When** the main screen loads, **Then** the background should be solid white and a character image should be displayed.
2. **Given** a meditation session is active and an interval ends, **When** the reminder sound plays, **Then** a new character should randomly pop up on the screen.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if there are no more character images to display? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How many character images are available? Should they repeat?]
- What if the character pop-up interferes with other UI elements? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Specify placement or size constraints for character pop-ups.]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a solid white background for the application.
- **FR-002**: System MUST display an initial character image when the application starts.
- **FR-003**: System MUST randomly display a character image at the end of each interval during a meditation session.
- **FR-004**: The character pop-up MUST be visually engaging. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Define "visually engaging" - e.g., animation, size, position?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Character Image**: Represents a graphic that can be displayed.
